# Citi Bike Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge to help determine the viability of a Citi Bike program in Iowa. The reference data is comprised of New York City Citi Bike data. Using Tableau we created visualizations to use in a story to showcase the benefits of a Citi Bike program in a given city.

## Results

The following screeshots display the results of my analysis. I decided to tell a story based on gender breakdowns of rides.

## Summary

As a result of this analysis I could conclude that male subscribers comprised the lion's share rides in the NYC area. So in order to establish a Citi Bike program in another city, one could reasonably rely on males to subscribe and use the service the most. But in order to make the program as successful as possible, targeted marketing could be done to entice people of all genders to participate and enroll in the program.
